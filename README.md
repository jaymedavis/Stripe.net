# Stripe.net

After working on Stripe.net for ~5 years, it is now an official Stripe binding! Thank you to everyone that contributed, even the smallest question taught me a lot. Feel free to [ask me anything]("https://github.com/jaymedavis/stripe.net/issues/new"). 

It has been transfered to Stripe for maintenance [here]("https://github.com/stripe/stripe-dotnet")
